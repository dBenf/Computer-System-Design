# Computer System Design
This repository contains the final project and some exam traces performed of the **Computer System Design** course (AY 21/22) at the *University of Naples Federico II*.

## Final Project
The [project](/STM_project) consists of programming two *ST Microelectronics* boards in asynchronous communication mode, with each one receiving and forwarding strings, and downstream of a control turning on an **RGB LED** of a different colour depending on the outcome of that control. 

## Exam Traces

The [exam traces](/exam_traces) folder contains some completed examination papers. Some of these traces **may contain incorrect information** regarding the **memory schema** and the **M68000 Assembly code**.
